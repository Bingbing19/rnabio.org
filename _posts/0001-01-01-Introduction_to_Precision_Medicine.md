### Key concepts
* RNA-seq, library strategies, RNA splicing, genes and transcripts, transcription strand, gene/transcript abundance estimation, FPKM and TPM, differential expression (DE) analysis, normalization, batch effects. 

### Learning objectives
* Perform alignment of RNA-seq data and a basic QC analysis of the resulting alignments
* Obtain gene and transcript abundance estimates
* Perform a reference-free alignment and abundance estimation and contrast the results with the reference based approach
* Basic differential expression analysis
* Perform an expression outlier analysis
* Run an RNA fusion detection tool and parse the results for interesting candidates
* Assess expression of specific gene markers of relevance (e.g. HER2, ER, PR)
* Assess the expression of specific variants identified in previous sections.
* Identify an example of allele specific expression
